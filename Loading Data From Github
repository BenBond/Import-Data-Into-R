#Loading CSVs from Github into R
#How to...
dat.save.rain <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/subartle/hello-world/master/Save.the.Rain.1.csv"
                    , sep = ","
                    , header = TRUE)

#Step 1: Access the Github Repository that is making the data available. 
#Step 2: Click on the data you are interested in. 
#Step 3: Three options should appear in the top right - "Raw", "Blame" and History. For csv files, click "Raw". It should take you to a seperate URL.
#Step 4: Once redirected to the sepearte, comma seperated values view, copy the URL and paste it into the above code. 
#Step 5. I've titled my dataframe "dat.save.rain". You will have a distinct name for your dataframes. 

#A mistake you can make would be to not hit "Raw" and copy down an ineffective URL (see below)
